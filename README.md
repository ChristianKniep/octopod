# Octopod - Jekyll based podcast delivery for geeks

Octopod is set of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) templates and helpers to deliver your podcasts the cool, stable and PHP free way.

If you are afraid of the command line of your computer or it's important for you to store data dynamically in a database, Octopod may be not the right choice for you. But if it's the case that feel good while thinking about textfiles in a version control system and delivering static files, you should take a look at Octopod.

Octopod is simply a pre configured Jekyll website, optimised for Podcasting.  
Octopod brings from the start:
* an iTunes ready episode RSS feed
* a [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) based layout
* [audio.js](http://kolber.github.com/audiojs/) web player
* [Flattr](https://flattr.com/) support on the website and in the episode feed
* comments via [Disqus](http://disqus.com/)

## Credits

Some of this code is not written by me.  
I shamelessly took some lines from other projects. And of cause Octopod is based on a list of frameworks, tools and plugins.

For instance there are:
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [audio.js](http://kolber.github.com/audiojs/)
* [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
* And the ones I've forgotten
