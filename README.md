# Octopod - Jekyll based podcast delivery for geeks

Octopod is a set of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) templates and helpers to deliver your podcasts the cool, stable and PHP free way.

If you are afraid of the command line of your computer or it's important for you to store data dynamically in a database or if you dislike the idea of convention over configuration, Octopod may be not the right choice for you. But if it's the case that you feel good while thinking about textfiles in a version control system and delivering static files, you should take a look at Octopod.

Octopod is simply a pre configured Jekyll website withe a few additions, optimised for Podcasting.  
Octopod brings from the start:
* iTunes ready episode feeds for different file formats
* a ready to use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) based layout
* [Flattr](https://flattr.com/) support on the website and in the episode feed
* comments via [Disqus](http://disqus.com/)
* [Podlove Alternate Feeds](http://podlove.org/alternate-feeds/)

## Credits

Some of this code is not written by me.  
I shamelessly took some lines from other projects. And of cause Octopod is based on a list of frameworks, tools and plugins.

Gratitude be to:
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [audio.js](http://kolber.github.com/audiojs/)
* [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
* And the ones I've forgotten
