# Octopod - Jekyll based podcast delivery for geeks

Octopod is set of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) templates and helpers to deliver your podcasts the cool, stable and PHP free way.

## Credits

Some of this code is not written by me.  
I shamelessly took some lines from other projects. And of cause Octopod is based on a list of frameworks, tools and plugins.

For instance there are:
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [audio.js](http://kolber.github.com/audiojs/)
* [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
* And the ones I've forgotten
